/*
Problem: Most frequent element in an array
Given an array, the task is to find the most frequent element in it. If there are multiple elements that appear a maximum number of times, return the maximum element.

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1]
Output : 1
Explanation: 1 appears three times in array which is maximum frequency.


Input : arr[] = [10, 20, 10, 20, 30, 20, 20]
Output : 20 appears four times in array which is maximum frequency


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 4, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 2 both appear two times, so return 2 as itâ€™s value is bigger.

Time: O(n Log n)
Space: O(1)

Hint: Sorting brings similar elements next to each other, making frequency counting easier.

    if (currCnt > maxCnt || (currCnt === maxCnt && arr[i] > res)) {
      maxCnt = currCnt;
